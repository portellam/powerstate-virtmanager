# pwrstat-virtman
Suspend or resume (sleep or wake) a given QEMU/KVM virtual machine.

# Why?
The commonly used Linux application *virt-manager* does not have the option to wake a VM from sleep (as of 2024). This is unfortunate, as a VM cannot be awaken from normal user-input (wake from USB keyboard or network activity).
