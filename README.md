# pwrstat-virtman
Set power state of a given QEMU/KVM virtual machine. Includes sleep, hibernate, and wake from sleep. Simple GTK3 GUI application.

# Why?
My daily driver application *virt-manager* does not (currently) have the option to wake a VM from sleep. That is unfortunate, as my VM cannot be awaken from normal and expected means (wake from USB keyboard or network activity).
