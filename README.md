# pwrstat-virtman
Suspend or resume (sleep or wake) a given QEMU/KVM virtual machine. Simple GTK3 GUI application.

# Why?
My daily driver application *virt-manager* does not (currently) have the option to wake a VM from sleep. That is unfortunate, as my VM cannot be awaken from normal and expected means (wake from USB keyboard or network activity).
