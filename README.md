### Why?
The virtual machine manager application `virt-manager` does not (currently) have the option to wake a VM from Sleep.
That is unfortunate, as a VM cannot be awaken from normal and expected means (wake from USB keyboard or network activity).
This application fixes that issue, with a nice Frontend to boot.

## TODO:
